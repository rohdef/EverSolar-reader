The effect data from the solar panels turned out to contain too much
noise to draw any useful conclusions.  Despite the fact that no clear
connection has been found there are a lot of ways that conditions for
data analysis can be improved.  Thus it is likely that refinement of
the conditions given will provide a better basis for analysis.
Especially considering the fact that other research projects has seen
a clear connection between clouds and PVs, improving the system with
more PVs for data aggregation and smoothing out noise would be a
logical next step to improve this research.
