\subsection{Weather sensing}
There has already been some research in measuring weather data by
utilizing some of the sensor capabilities that arises from the
increasing amount of technology in use.

OpenSignal have created the app WeatherSignal that utilized phone
battery temperatures \citep{temperatures2013} to deduce information
about the air temperature in heavily populated areas.  They proved a
strong relation between the temperature of a the phone batteries and
the outside temperatures.  The authors believe that the data can be
further improved, if the data can be calibrated according to phone
models and if the phone is inside or outside, as heating and air
conditions bias the data.

A correlation between the radio signals used for phones and rain
measurements has also been proved.
