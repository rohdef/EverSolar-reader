%\subsection{Weather sensing}
PV systems work by having two silicon parts (N-type and P-type) that
when exposed to photons have an electron reaction used to produce
power.  The fact that photons are needed to produce electricity
indicates that things that affects the amount of light reaching the
earth (apart from light vs no light) is likely to have an effect.
When the silicon is doped to produce the N-type and P-type parts it is
doped with materials that react with the longer wavelengths of light,
i.e. closer to the infrared wavelengths, to minimize the impact from
clouds \citep{photovoltaic}.  The fact that it's only minimizing
however indicates that there is at least some effect.

That this suspicion is true is further supported by research done to
smooth out the impact from cloud coverage on large scale systems
\citep{southafrica, cloudTrack}.

There has already been some research in measuring weather data by
utilizing some of the sensor capabilities that arises from the
increasing amount of technology in use.

OpenSignal have created the app WeatherSignal that utilized phone
battery temperatures \citep{temperatures2013} to deduce information
about the air temperature in heavily populated areas.  They proved a
strong relation between the temperature of a the phone batteries and
the outside temperatures.  The authors believe that the data can be
further improved, if the data can be calibrated according to phone
models and if the phone is inside or outside, as heating and air
conditions bias the data.

A correlation between the radio signals used for phones and rain
measurements has also been proved \citep{rainfall2007}.  The radio
signals can be used to measure the amount of rain in between two
points.  The measurements is fairly accurate, and it's assumed that
they can be further improved if improved for the signal loss due to
wet antennas.

It is believe that the combination of various weather sensing
techniques such as \cite{rainfall2007}, \cite{temperatures2013} and
measurement of clouds by PV systems, such as proposed in this article,
is likely to have some useful potential.  For instance the maximum
power point tracking units of PV systems can be improved with weather
data \citep{mppt2004}.
