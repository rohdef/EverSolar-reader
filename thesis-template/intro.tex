Photovoltaic modules (PV), commonly known as solar panels, works by
having two silicon based semiconductors, namely a n-type and a p-type.
The two semiconductors react when exposed to photons which is used to
create electricity \citep{photovoltaic}.

It has already been found that weather data to is relevant for PV
generating systems, when maximum power point tracking is used to
maximize the power output, mainly temperature and radiation \citep{mppt2004}.

\todo{BAsed on this we want to try to correlate power generated with cloud conditions}
